## Purpose of this Project

The typical way to ensure application security is to hire a security specialist (aka. penetration tester) at some point in your project to check the application for security bugs and vulneribilities. Usualy this happens very late in the project. This has some drawbacks:

1. Nowadays lot of projects do continuous delivery, which means multiple deployments a day. The penetretaion tester can only check the application at a given snapshot in this development process. But some commits later there mey be new security issues introduced. So in conseuence a penetration tester should also continuously check the application. But this is not affordable.
2. The penetration tester may be bothered with simple to fix (low hanging fruit) issues and maybe will not even go to the serious security issues in the typically time boxed analysis.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuously scan applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues in the development process. So that a penetration tester can concentrate on the major security issues.

It **is not** the purpose of *secureCodeBox* to make penetration testers obsolete. We strongly recommend that you let check your application by one!

## How does it Works

The core of the _secureCodeBox_ is the controll center (a web UI). With this the whole scan process is defined. An example process is shown in the image below.

The scan itself may be triggered via the control center or via web hooks. The web hooks gives the posibility to trigger a scann by a CI such as Jenkins, Travis CI, Bamboo or such. The scan itself will be handover to the scanners and the results will be aggregated for review in the control center or CI. For a detailed description of the components and how they work together see the [architecture](#architecture) section.

**Important note**: The _secureCodeBox_ is no simple one button click solution! You must have a deep understanding of security and how to configure the scanners. Also it is necessary that you understand the results of of the scans and how to interpret them.
